## Hi there 👋

## 👋 About Me

I’m Alec Worthy — a data-driven analyst with a strong foundation in extracting insights from complex data to support smarter business decisions.

With more than a decade of experience across the retail and events industries, I’ve combined hands-on analytical work with commercial impact, using data to understand performance trends, optimise processes, and influence outcomes. My work blends curiosity with structured problem-solving — whether that’s developing KPI frameworks, building SQL-based analytics workflows, or using Python for exploratory data analysis.

I enjoy turning raw data into clear, actionable insights and visualisations that help teams make better decisions. I’m building a portfolio that showcases this work, with a focus on SQL, Python, and real-world analytical problem solving.

### 🔍 What I’m Good At
- SQL (joins, aggregation, window functions, data modelling)
- Python (Pandas, EDA, charting)
- Data cleaning, quality assurance, and reporting
- Translating business questions into analytical solutions
- Communicating insights to stakeholders

### 📍 Based in Sydney, Australia
I’m actively seeking Data Analyst opportunities where I can apply analytical skills to drive business value and grow in a collaborative, insight-focused team.
